Your task is to provide a personalized learning path with two parts:
1.  **Recommended Topics:** Identify and recommend 3-5 specific topics or chapters within these subjects that are crucial for the JEE. For each topic, provide a brief (1-2 sentence) explanation of why it's important and what key concepts to focus on.
2.  **Suggested Resources:** Suggest 2-3 generic but helpful resource titles that would help the student learn these topics. For each resource, provide a brief (1 sentence) description of what it might cover. These should be example titles, not links to real content.

Please provide the output in the specified JSON format.`;
